Android needs to be able to determine if there is a captive portal on the network or if a network has Internet connectivity at all
To do so it polls a server on every connection and also periodically
This is a privacy issue.

There are multiple solutions:
	- Use the default Google gen204 endpoint
		- Google is not the most privacy friendly
	- Disable the checks
		- Would confuse users when behind a captive portal
		+ Would potentially save a small amount of battery
	- Use our own gen204 endpoint
		- Not everyone will trust us (even if they're running our code)
	- Randomly choose between many different endpoints
		- We'd need permission
		+ Would be the best
		+ Would limit one actor from knowing all
		- If a maintainer wants us to stop using theirs it'd take a while since not everyone updates instantly
		- If a maintainer blocked it, it'd cause issues (no Internet symbol when there is)
